            <p>
                My name is Carlo Oliva and I am a 5th year Computing Science student at the University of Alberta with an
                estimated completion date of April 2019. Coursework includes Database Management, Software Engineering
                and Project Management, and Algorithms.<br><br>
                Outside of school, my interests include tennis, CrossFit, and olympic weightlifting.

            <p>
                From May 2018 to December 2018, I was a Software Developer Intern at Strathcom Media where I learned
                proper project management and version control using GitHub. For 4 of the 8 months I maintained legacy
                code as well as well as create data pipelines to clean and extract incoming data. The rest of the
                internship was spent learning how WordPress worked and how to create plugins as well as proper debugging
                using different debug tools.<br><br>

                From January 2018 to present, I have been working as a Software Developer for the University of Alberta
                - Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine. I worked on and created a web, iOS and Android application to help
                locate vulnerable people with Dementia.
